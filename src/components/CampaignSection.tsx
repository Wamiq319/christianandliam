          Liam & Christina's Story
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-xl mb-4 text-gray-700">
          Liam is a bright and loving 11-year-old boy living with cerebral
          palsy, epilepsy, and multiple medical challenges. He’s non-verbal,
          non-ambulatory, and fully dependent on his wheelchair — but he’s full
          of joy, humor, and resilience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg mb-4 text-gray-600">
          Christina, his devoted mother, has been by his side through countless
          hospital stays, surgeries, and daily care. She’s doing everything she
          can — but now they need your help. Their current vehicle is failing
          and can no longer safely transport Liam’s wheelchair and medical
          equipment.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-600">
          Your support will help them purchase a reliable, fully accessible van.
          This means Liam can travel safely to school, doctor appointments, and
          even enjoy simple joys like visiting Disneyland.
